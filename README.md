# Semirings

This library provides a type class for (gight) pre-semirings & semirings as well as some useful instances. The `Semiring` class imposes fairly minimal requirementsâ€”the various 'add-on' properties  (e.g. commutativity) are catalogued in `Data.Semiring.Property`.

Support for a wide range of pre-semirings and semirings and interoperability with `base` were primary considerations.
