# Semirings

This library provides constraint kinds for (right) pre-semirings, semirings, and rings, as well as some useful instances.
The `Semiring` kind imposes fairly minimal requirementsâ€”the various 'add-on' properties  (e.g. multiplicative commutativity) are catalogued in `Data.Semiring.Property`.
